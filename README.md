This Minecraft plugin was built from nostalgia for the old Minecade villager defense games.
Seeing as it won't come back, I decided to make my own version. I tried to keep some elements like the original, but
with a modern twist.
The plugin was built with customization in mind, however, so that each server running this plugin can have its own
unique features and takes.
Let me know what you think of it!
